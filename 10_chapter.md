Mathematical Induction.     

Outline for Proof by Induction.     
Proposition The statements S_1, S_2, S_3, ... are all true.     

Proof. (Induction)     
(1) Prove that the first statement S_1 is true.     
(2) Given any integer k >= 1, prove that the statement S_k => S_k+1 is true.     
It follows by mathematical induction that every S_n is true.     


Example:     
Proposition. If n in N, then 1+3+5+7+...+(2n-1) = n^2.     
Proof.     
(1) Observe that if n = 1, this statement is 1 = 1^2, which is true.     
(2) We must prove S_k => S_k+1 for any k >= 1.     
That is if 1+3+5+7+...+(2k - 1) = k^2, then 1+3+5+7+...+(2(k+1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2.     
Direct proof. Suppose 1+3+5+7+...+(2k - 1) = k^2.     
Then 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2 (k + 1) - 1) =       
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2 (k + 1) - 1) =     
(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2k - 1)) + (2 (k + 1) - 1) =      
k^2 + (2 (k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2      
This proves that S_k => S_k+1.     
It follows by induction that 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2n - 1) = n^2 for every n in N.     


Proposition If n is a non-negative integer, then 5 | (n^2 - n).     
(1) If n = 0, 0 = 5x.    
(2) Let k >= 0, we need to prove that if 5 | (k^5 - k), then 5 | ((k+1)^5 - (k+1)).     
k^5 - k = 5x.     
(k + 1)^5 - (k + 1) = k^5 + 5k^4 + 10k^3 + 10k^2 + 5k + 1 - k - 1 =      
= (k^5 - k) + 5(k^4 + 2k^3 + 2k^2 + k) =       
= 5x + 5(...) = 5(x + ...).     
It follows by induction that 5 | (n^5 - n) for all non-negative integers n.     


Proposition For each n in N, it follows that 2^n <= 2^(n+1) - 2^(n-1) - 1.     
(1) If n = 1, then 2 <= 4 - 1 - 1      
(2) Suppose k >= 1. We need to show that 2^k <= 2^(k+1) - 2^(k-1) - 1 implies 2^(k+1) <= 2^(k+2) - 2^k - 1      
2^k <= 2^(k+1) - 2^(k-1) - 1.     
Multiply both sides by 2.     
2^(k+1) <= 2^(k+2) - 2^k - 2.      
Add 1 to the right side (it doesn't change inequation).      
2^(k+1) <= 2^(k+2) - 2^k - 1.     
It follows by induction that 2^n <= 2^(n+1) - 2^(n-1) - 1 for each n in N.     


Proposition 10.1 Suppose a_1, a_2, ... , a_n are n integers, where n >= 2. If p is prime and p | (a_1 * a_2 * a_3 ... * a_n), then p | a_i for at least one of the a_i.     
(1) Basic step. For n = 2. Suppose p | (a_1 * a_2), then p | a_1 or p | a_2. Or p !| a_1 AND p | a_2.      
If p !| a_1 => gcd(p, a_1) = 1.      
Then 1 = pk + a_1l.        
Multiply both sides by a_2.     
a_2 = a_2pk + a_1a_2l.      
p | a_2pk and p | a_1a_2l (by our proposition).      
(2) For k > 2.      
Show that p | (a_1a_2 ... a_k). Suppose p | (a_1a_2 ... a_k * a_k+1).      
By what we proved in basic step it follows that p | (a_1 * a_2 ... a_k) or p | (a_k+1).     



Proof by strong induction.     
Outline.     

Proposition The statements S_1, S_2, S_3, ... are all true.     
Proof (Strong induction)     
(1) Prove the first statement S_1. (Or the first several S_n.)     
(2) Given any integer k >= 1, prove (S_1 ^ S_2 ^ S_3 ^ ... ^ S_k) => S_k+1.     

Somtimes it's difficult to show that S_k forces S_k+1 to be true.     
Instead some "lower" statements S_m (with m < k) force S_k+1 to be true.    
With strong induction in Step (2) instead of assuming S_k is true, we assume that all the statents S_1, S_2, ..., S_k are true and show this forces S_k+1 to be true.     

Example:     
Proposition If n in N, then 12 | (n^4 - n^2)     
(1) Observe, that this statement is true for the first 6 n.      
(2) Let k >= 6, assume 12 | (m^4 - m^2) for 1 <= m <= k. (All statements S_1, S_2, ..., S_k are all true).     
=> m^4 - m^2 = 12a.     
We must show that 12 | ((k+1)^4 - (k+1)^2).     
Since S_k-5 is true, we have 12 | ((k-5)^4 - (k-5)^2).     
Let m = k - 5, k = m + 5.     
(k+1)^4 - (k+1)^2 = (m+6)^4 - (m+6)^2 = ... = (m^4 - m^2) + 24m^3 + 216m^2 + 852m + 1260 =       
= 12a + ... = 12(...).     
We get 12 | ((k+1)^2 - (k+1)^2).     


Graphs     
Is a structure with vertices and edges.    
Cycle is when it's possible to from one distinct vertex to another in a "loop".     
Graphs with no cycles called trees.    
A tree always have n - 1 edges given that there is an n vertices.     

Example:      
Proposition. If n in N, prove that there is n - 1 edge in a tree.
