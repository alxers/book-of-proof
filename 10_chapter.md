Mathematical Induction.     

Outline for Proof by Induction.     
Proposition The statements S_1, S_2, S_3, ... are all true.     

Proof. (Induction)     
(1) Prove that the first statement S_1 is true.     
(2) Given any integer k >= 1, prove that the statement S_k => S_k+1 is true.     
It follows by mathematical induction that every S_n is true.     


Example:     
Proposition. If n in N, then 1+3+5+7+...+(2n-1) = n^2.
