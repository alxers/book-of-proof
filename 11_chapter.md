Relations

Definition 11.1 A relation on a set A is a subset R set_in A x A. Abbreviated as (x, y) in R as xRy.     

Example 11.1 Let A = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }.     
R = { (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1) } set_in A x A.     
1R1, 2R1, ... etc.     
R is greater-then-or-equal set.
