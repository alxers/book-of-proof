Relations

Definition 11.1 A relation on a set A is a subset R set_in A x A. Abbreviated as (x, y) in R as xRy.     

Example 11.1 Let A = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }.     
R = { (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1) } set_in A x A.     
1R1, 2R1, ... etc.     
R is greater-then-or-equal set.

.6. Congruence modulo5 is a relation on the set A = Z. In this relation xRy means x ≡ y(mod5). Write out the set R in set-builder notation.      
R = { (x, y) in Z : 5 | x - y }       



.7. Write the relation < on the set A = Z as a subset R of Z x Z. This is an infinite set, so you will have to use set-builder notation.

.9. Let A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }. How many different relations are there on the set A ?       
There are 2^|A| = 2^6 subsets of A.      
There are 36 ordered pairs in A.       
So 2^36 many different relations.     

.10. Consider the subset R = (R x R) - { (x,x) : x in R } set_in R x R. What familiar relation onRis this? Explain.        
(R x R) is 2D plane, { (x,x) : x in R } is an equal coordinates.     
Remove all equal coordinates from 2D plane, you get all non-equal coordinates.          


.11. Given a finite set A, how many different relations are there on A ?     
There are 2^|A| subsets of A.      
There are |A| * |A| = |A|^2 ordered pairs in A.       
So 2^(|A|^2) many different relations.     

In the following exercises, R of R^2 = R x R or Z^2 = Z x Z indicated by gray shading. In each case, R is a familiar relation on R or Z. State it.

11.2 Properties of Relations
Definition 11.2 Suppose R is a relation on a set A.     

.1. Relation R is reflexive if xRx for every x in A.     
That is, R is reflexive if all x in A, xRx.     

.2. Relation R is symmetric if xRy implies yRx for all x,y in A.    
That is, R is symmetric if all x, y in A, xRy => yRx.       

.3. Relation R is transitive if whenever xRy and yRz, then also xRz.     
That is, R is transitive if for all x, y, z in A, ((xRy) ^ (yRz)) => xRz.     


Example 11.7. A = { b, c, d, e }, and R is the following relation on A: R { (b, b), (b, c), (c, b), (c, c), (d, d), (b, d), (d, b), (c, d), (d, c) }.      
.1. It's not reflexive, because it's not true that eRe. (should be true for all x in A).      
.2. It's symmetric, whenever we have xRy, it follows yRx too.      
.3. It's transitive.     


Example 11.8 Prove the following proposition.     
Proposition. Let n in N. The relation ≡ (mod n) on the set Z is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.     
1) Show that it's reflexive.     
For all integers in Z it's true that n | 0.     
n | (x - x), which is x ≡ x (mod n) by definition.     
So it's reflexive.     
2) Show that it's symmetric.      
For all x, y in Z it must be true that if x ≡ y (mod n) then y ≡ x (mod n).     
Suppose x ≡ y (mod n). Then n | (x - y).     
Then x - y = na for some a.      
Multiply by (-1) both sides, y - x = n(-a).     
Then n | (y - x), y ≡ x (mod n).     
3) Show that it's transitive.     
Show that if x ≡ y (mod n) and y ≡ z (mod n), then x ≡ z (mod n).      
n | (x - y) and n | (y - z), then x - y = na, y - z = nb.      
x - y + y - z = na + nb.     
x - z = n(a + b).     
n | (x - z).     
x ≡ z (mod n).
