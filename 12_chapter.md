Functions     


Definition 12.1 Suppose A and B are sets. A function f from A to B (denoted as f : A -> B) is a relation f set_in A x B from A to B, satisfying theproperty that for each a in A the relation f contains exactly one ordered pair of form (a,b). The statement (a,b) in f is abbreviated f(a) = b.     


Definition 12.2 For a function f : A -> B, the set A is called the domain off. (Think of the domain as the set of possible "input values" for f.) Theset B is called the codomainoff. The range of f is the set { f(a) : a in A } = { b : (a, b) in f }. (Think of the range as the set of all possible "output values" for f. Think of the codomain as a sort of "target" for the outputs.).       


Exercises for Section 12.1.      
.1. Suppose A = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }, B = { 2, 3, 4, 5 } and f = { (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 2) }. State the domain and range of f. Find f(2) and f(1).      
Domain = A, range = { 2, 3, 4 }, f(2) = 4, f(1) = 3.     


.2. Suppose A = { a, b, c, d }, B = { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } and f = { (a, 2), (b, 3), (c, 4), (d, 5) }. State the domain and range off. Find f(b) and f(d).      
Domain = A, range = { 2, 3, 4, 5 }, f(b) = 3, f(d) = 5.       


.3. There are four different functions f : { a, b } -> { 0, 1 }. List them. Diagrams suffice.     
f_1 = { (a, 0), (b, 0) }, f_2 = { (a, 1), (b, 0) }, f_3 = { (a, 0), (b, 1) } f_4 = { (a, 1), (b, 1) }.     


.5. Give an example of a relation from { a, b, c, d } to { d, e } that is not a function.     
f = { (a, d), (b, e) }. By definition of a function it should be for all a in A. (???).     


.6. Suppose f : Z -> Z is defined as f = { (x,4x+5) : x in Z }. State the domain, codomainand range off. Find f (10).     
Domain = A, codomain = Z, range f(x) = 4x + 5 {..., 9, 13, 17, ... } (???).     
f(10) = 45.      


.7. Consider the set f = { (x, y) in Z x Z : 3x + y = 4 }. Is this a function from Z to Z? Explain.      
It's a function.     
y = 4 - 3x.     


.8. Consider the set f = { (x, y) in Z x Z : x + 3y = 4 }. Is this a function from Z to Z? Explain.   
y = (4 - x)/3.     
Not from Z to Z.      


.9. Consider the set f = { (x^2, x) : x in R }. Is this a function from R to R? Explain.     
It's possible to have x = 2, x^2 = 4, x = -2, x^2 = 4.     
y definition of a function it should be that for all a in A there is exactly one ordered pair (a, b).      
So f is not a function.      


.10. Consider the set f = { (x^3, x) : x in R }. Is this a function from R to R? Explain.     
f is a function.      


.11. Is the set theta = { (X,|X|) : X set_in Z_5 } a function? If so, what is its domain and range?
