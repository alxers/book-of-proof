Functions     


Definition 12.1 Suppose A and B are sets. A function f from A to B (denoted as f : A -> B) is a relation f set_in A x B from A to B, satisfying theproperty that for each a in A the relation f contains exactly one ordered pair of form (a,b). The statement (a,b) in f is abbreviated f(a) = b.     


Definition 12.2 For a function f : A -> B, the set A is called the domain off. (Think of the domain as the set of possible "input values" for f.) Theset B is called the codomainoff. The range of f is the set { f(a) : a in A } = { b : (a, b) in f }. (Think of the range as the set of all possible "output values" for f. Think of the codomain as a sort of "target" for the outputs.).
