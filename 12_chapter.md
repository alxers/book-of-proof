Functions     


Definition 12.1 Suppose A and B are sets. A function f from A to B (denoted as f : A -> B) is a relation f set_in A x B from A to B, satisfying theproperty that for each a in A the relation f contains exactly one ordered pair of form (a,b). The statement (a,b) in f is abbreviated f(a) = b.     


Definition 12.2 For a function f : A -> B, the set A is called the domain off. (Think of the domain as the set of possible "input values" for f.) Theset B is called the codomainoff. The range of f is the set { f(a) : a in A } = { b : (a, b) in f }. (Think of the range as the set of all possible "output values" for f. Think of the codomain as a sort of "target" for the outputs.).       


Exercises for Section 12.1.      
.1. Suppose A = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }, B = { 2, 3, 4, 5 } and f = { (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 2) }. State the domain and range of f. Find f(2) and f(1).      
Domain = A, range = { 2, 3, 4 }, f(2) = 4, f(1) = 3.     


.2. Suppose A = { a, b, c, d }, B = { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } and f = { (a, 2), (b, 3), (c, 4), (d, 5) }. State the domain and range off. Find f(b) and f(d).      
Domain = A, range = { 2, 3, 4, 5 }, f(b) = 3, f(d) = 5.
