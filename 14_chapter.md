Exercises for Section 14.1     

.4. The set of even integers and the set of odd integers.      
f(x) = x + 1      
Injective, f(a) = f(b) => a = b,     
Let a = 2m, b = 2n,      
f(a) = 2m + 1, f(b) = 2n + 1.      
2m + 1 = 2n + 1 => m = n.     
Surjective, b in odd, a in even,      
Let a = 2k, f(a) = 2k + 1 = b.      


.6. N and S = { sqrt(2)/n : n in N }     
f(x) = sqrt(2)/x.       
Injective       
f(x) = f(y) => sqrt(2)/x = sqrt(2)/y => x = y      
Surjective       
b in { sqrt(2)/n : n in N }, a in N       
f(a) = sqrt(2)/a = b      


.8. Z and S = { x in R : sinx = 1 }     
f(x) = (pi/2 + 2npi)      
Injective       
f(x) = f(y) => pi/2 + 2xpi = pi/2 + 2ypi => x = y     
Surjective      
b in { x in R : sinx = 1 }, a in Z      
f(a) = pi/2 + 2api = b     


.12. N and Z      
See Ex. 18, section 12.2

.16. Verify that the function f in Example 14.3 is a bijection     
Injective   
f(a) = a/(a + 1), f(b) = b/(b + 1)       
a/(a + 1) = b/(b + 1)      
a(b + 1) = b(a + 1)       
ab + a = ab + b      
a = b     
Surjective
b in (0, 1), a in (0, inf)      
let b = 1 - 1/(a + 1)     
f(a) = a/(a + 1) = 1 - 1/(a + 1) = b.     


Exercises for Section 14.2      

.4. Prove that the set of all irrational numbers is uncountable.     
R is a union of rationals and irrationals, rationals (Q) are countably infinie, by Theorem 13.6 (14 in third edition) union of two countably infinite are also countably infinite, but R is not countably infinite. Contradiction.     


.8. Prove or disprove: The set Z x Q is countably infinite.      
Since Z and Q are countably infinite, Z x Q is also countably infinite by Theorem 14.5 (third edition).     


Excercises for Section 14.3      


.2. Prove that the set C of complex numbers is uncountable.     
R set_in C, R is uncountable => C is uncountable.     


.4. Prove or disprove: If A set_in B set_in C and A and C are countably infinite, then B is countably infinite.     
Since A set_in B and A is infinite, then B must be infinite.     
Then, C is countably infinite, so by Theorem 13.8 (14.8) B is countably infinite.     


.6. Prove or disprove: Every infinite set is a subset of a countably infinite set.      
False. Counterexample. N is an infinite set, but N set_in R and R is not countably infinite.
