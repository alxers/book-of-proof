Cardinality of Sets.      


Exercises for Section 14.1     

.4. The set of even integers and the set of odd integers.      
f(x) = x + 1      
Injective, f(a) = f(b) => a = b,     
Let a = 2m, b = 2n,      
f(a) = 2m + 1, f(b) = 2n + 1.      
2m + 1 = 2n + 1 => m = n.     
Surjective, b in odd, a in even,      
Let a = 2k, f(a) = 2k + 1 = b.      


.6. N and S = { sqrt(2)/n : n in N }     
f(x) = sqrt(2)/x.       
Injective       
f(x) = f(y) => sqrt(2)/x = sqrt(2)/y => x = y      
Surjective       
b in { sqrt(2)/n : n in N }, a in N       
f(a) = sqrt(2)/a = b      


.8. Z and S = { x in R : sinx = 1 }     
f(x) = (pi/2 + 2npi)      
Injective       
f(x) = f(y) => pi/2 + 2xpi = pi/2 + 2ypi => x = y     
Surjective      
b in { x in R : sinx = 1 }, a in Z      
f(a) = pi/2 + 2api = b     


.12. N and Z      
See Ex. 18, section 12.2

.16. Verify that the function f in Example 14.3 is a bijection     


Exercises for Section 14.2
