Chapter 14.      
Cardinality of Sets.      

.4. The set of even integers and the set of odd integers.      
f(x) = x + 1      
Injective, f(a) = f(b) => a = b,     
Let a = 2m, b = 2n,      
f(a) = 2m + 1, f(b) = 2n + 1.      
2m + 1 = 2n + 1 => m = n.     
Surjective, b in odd, a in even,      
Let a = 2k, f(a) = 2k + 1 = b.
