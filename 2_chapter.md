Exercises for Section 2.5
Write a truth table the logial statements:

1. P or (Q => R)
T or (T => T) T
T or (T => F) T
T or (F => T) T
T or (F => F) T
F or (T => T) T
F or (T => F) T
F or (F => T) F
F or (F => F) F

2. (Q or R) <=> (R and Q)
(T or T) <=> (T and T) T
(T or F) <=> (F and T) F
(F or T) <=> (T and F) F
(F or F) <=> (F and F) T

3. ~(P => Q)
~(T => T) F
~(T => F) T
~(F => T) F
~(F => F) F

4. ~(P or Q) or (~P)
~(T or T) or (~T) F
~(T or F) or (~T) F
~(F or T) or (~F) F
~(F or F) or (~F) T

6. (P and ~P) and Q
(T and ~T) and T F
(T and ~T) and F F
(F and ~F) and T F
(T and ~T) and F F

9. ~(~P and ~Q)
~(~T and ~T) T
~(~T and ~F) T
~(~F and ~T) T
~(~F and ~F) F

10. Suppose the statement ((P and Q) or R) => (R or S) is false. Find the truth values of P, Q, R and S (can be done without truth table).
((P and Q) or R) must be false
P - false, R - false, Q - true, S - true

11. Suppose P is false and that the statement (R => S) <=> (P and Q) is true. Find the truth values of R and S.

If P is false then (P and Q) is also false
? <=> F evalates to true only when ? is false
(R => S) is false only if R is false and S is true
