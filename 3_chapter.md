Counting

A list is an ordered sequence of objects.
(a, b, c, d, e) != (b, a, c, d, e)

A list is somewhat like a set, but set is unordered
{ a, b, c, d, e } = { b, a, c, d, e }

It's often needed to count up the number of possible lists that satisfy some condition or property.
F.e. we need to make a list of length three such that the first entry must be in { a, b, c }, the second must be in { 5, 7 }, and the third must be in { a, x }.

How many such lists are there? 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 (multiplication principle)

The total number of different lists that can be made is the product a_1 * a_2 * a_3 ... a_n

There are two types of list-counting problems.
1. Repetition allowed.
2. Repetition is not allowed.

Example 3.2 Consider making lists from symbols A, B, C, D, E, F, G
(a) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is allowed?
(b) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is not allowed?
(c) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is not allowed and list must contain an E?
(d) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is allowed and list must contain an E?

Solutions:
(a) Image the list as containing four boxes filled with selections from letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   7   7   7  choices

7^4 = 2401

(b)

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   6   5   4

7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 840

(c)

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  E   6   5   4

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  6   E   5   4

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  6   5   E   4

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  6   5   4   E

(6 * 5 * 4) * 4 = 480

(d)

Wrong method:

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  E   7   7   7

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   E   7   7

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   7   E   7

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   7   7   E

7^3 * 4 = 1372

This is not correct, because f.e. list (E, E, A, B) counted multiple times

The correct way to solve this problem is to count all possible lists (like in (a)), then subtract all lists which do not contain an E.

1) All possible lists 7^4 = 2401
2) All lists without E: 6^4 = 1296
3) 2401 - 1296 = 1105

Example 3.3 This problem involves making lists of length seven from the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
(a) How many such lists are there if repetition is not allowed?
(b) How many such lists are there if repetition is not allowed and the
first three entries must be odd?
(c) How many such lists are there in which repetition is allowed, and the list must contain at least one repeated number?

Solutions:
(a) 7! = 5040
(b) Set { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } contains three odd and four even numbers. First three 3! * other even 4!
3! * 4! = 144
(c) There are 7^7 = 823543 lists where repetition is allowed. And 7! = 5040 where repetition is not allowed.
7^7 - 7! = 818503 lists with at least one repetition (or more).

Example 3.5 A single 5-card hand is dealt off of a standard 52-card deck.

To answer this, think of the deck as being a set D of 52 cards. Then a

52!/(5! * (52-5)!) = 2 598 960

Example 3.6 This problem concerns 5-card hands that can be dealt off of a 52-card deck. How many such hands are there in which two of the cards are clubs and three are hearts?

Solution: Think of such a hand as being described by a list of length
two of the form:
c - clubs
h - hearts
_ _  _ _ _
c c  h h h

where the first entry is a 2-element subset of the set of 13 club cards, and
the second entry is a 3-element subset of the set of 13 heart cards. There are
13!/(2! * 11!) choices for the first entry and 13!/(3! * 10!) for the second, so
by the multiplication principle there are 13!/(2! * 11!) * 13!/(3! * 10!) = 22 308

3.5 Inclusion-Exclusion

|A union B| = |A| + |B| - |A intersection B|

Example 3.8 A 3-card hand is dealt off of a standard 52-card deck. How
many different such hands are there for which all 3 cards are red or all
three cards are face cards?

Solution: Let A be a set of 3 card hands where all cards are red { {red, red, red }, ... }. Let B be a set of 3 card hands where all cards are face cards.
We need to get a number of 3 card hands that are all red OR all face and this number is |A union B|.
Any hand in A formed by selecting three cards from 26 red cards in the deck. So |A| = (26 choose 3). |B| = (12 choose 3).
(A intersection B) contains all red face 3-card hands.
The deck only has 6 red face cards, so |A intersection B| = (6 choose 3).
So the answer is |A union B| = |A| + |B| - |A intersection B| = (26 choose 3) + (12 choose 3) - (6 choose 3)

Fact 3.4 Additional principle
If A1, A2, ... An are sets with Ai intersection Aj = empty_set whenever i != j, then |A1 union A2 union ... An| = |A1| + |A2| + ... + |An|

Example 3.9 How many 7-digit binary strings (0010100, 1101011, etc.) have an odd number of 1's?

Let A be a set of all 7-digit binary strings with an odd number of 1's. Then |A| is the answer.
Any string in A will have either 1, 3, 5 or 7 1's.
Then |A| = |A_1| union |A_3| union |A_5| union |A_7|. Fact 3.4 gives that |A| = |A_1| + |A_3| + |A_5| + |A_7|

A_3 is a set of 7-digit binary strings with three 1's. There are (7 choose 3) such sets (|A_3| = (7 choose 3)).

Then |A| = (7 choose 1) + (7 choose 3) + (7 choose 5) + (7 choose 7)


Exercises for Section 3.5

1. At a certain university 523 of the seniors are history majors or math majors (or both). There are 100 senior math majors, and 33 seniors are majoring in both history and math. How many seniors are majoring in history?

|A union B| = |A| + |B| - |A intersection B|
