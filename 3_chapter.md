Counting

A list is an ordered sequence of objects.
(a, b, c, d, e) != (b, a, c, d, e)

A list is somewhat like a set, but set is unordered
{ a, b, c, d, e } = { b, a, c, d, e }

It's often needed to count up the number of possible lists that satisfy some condition or property.
F.e. we need to make a list of length three such that the first entry must be in { a, b, c }, the second must be in { 5, 7 }, and the third must be in { a, x }.

How many such lists are there? 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 (multiplication principle)

The total number of different lists that can be made is the product a_1 * a_2 * a_3 ... a_n

There are two types of list-counting problems.
1. Repetition allowed.
2. Repetition is not allowed.

Example 3.2 Consider making lists from symbols A, B, C, D, E, F, G
(a) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is allowed?
(b) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is not allowed?
(c) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is not allowed and list must contain an E?
(d) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is allowed and list must contain an E?

Solutions:
(a) Image the list as containing four boxes filled with selections from letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   7   7   7  choices

7^4 = 2401

(b)

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   6   5   4

7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 840

(c)

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  E   6   5   4

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  6   E   5   4

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  6   5   E   4

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  6   5   4   E

(6 * 5 * 4) * 4 = 480

(d)

Wrong method:

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  E   7   7   7

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   E   7   7

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   7   E   7

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   7   7   E

7^3 * 4 = 1372

This is not correct, because f.e. list (E, E, A, B) counted multiple times
