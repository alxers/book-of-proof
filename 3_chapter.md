Counting

A list is an ordered sequence of objects.
(a, b, c, d, e) != (b, a, c, d, e)

A list is somewhat like a set, but set is unordered
{ a, b, c, d, e } = { b, a, c, d, e }

It's often needed to count up the number of possible lists that satisfy some condition or property.
F.e. we need to make a list of length three such that the first entry must be in { a, b, c }, the second must be in { 5, 7 }, and the third must be in { a, x }.

How many such lists are there? 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 (multiplication principle)

The total number of different lists that can be made is the product a_1 * a_2 * a_3 ... a_n

There are two types of list-counting problems.
1. Repetition allowed.
2. Repetition is not allowed.

Example 3.2 Consider making lists from symbols A, B, C, D, E, F, G
(a) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is allowed?
(b) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is not allowed?
(c) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is not allowed and list must contain an E?
(d) How many length-4 lists are possible if repetition is allowed and list must contain an E?

Solutions:
(a) Image the list as containing four boxes filled with selections from letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   7   7   7  choices

7^4 = 2401

(b)

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   6   5   4

7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 840

(c)

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  E   6   5   4

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  6   E   5   4

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  6   5   E   4

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  6   5   4   E

(6 * 5 * 4) * 4 = 480

(d)

Wrong method:

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  E   7   7   7

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   E   7   7

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   7   E   7

( _ , _ , _ , _ )
  7   7   7   E

7^3 * 4 = 1372

This is not correct, because f.e. list (E, E, A, B) counted multiple times

The correct way to solve this problem is to count all possible lists (like in (a)), then subtract all lists which do not contain an E.

1) All possible lists 7^4 = 2401
2) All lists without E: 6^4 = 1296
3) 2401 - 1296 = 1105

Example 3.3 This problem involves making lists of length seven from the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
(a) How many such lists are there if repetition is not allowed?
(b) How many such lists are there if repetition is not allowed and the
first three entries must be odd?
(c) How many such lists are there in which repetition is allowed, and the list must contain at least one repeated number?

Solutions:
(a) 7! = 5040
(b) Set { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } contains three odd and four even numbers. First three 3! * other even 4!
3! * 4! = 144
(c) There are 7^7 = 823543 lists where repetition is allowed. And 7! = 5040 where repetition is not allowed.
7^7 - 7! = 818503 lists with at least one repetition (or more).

Exercises for Section 3.3
1. Suppose a set A has 37 elements. How many subsets of A have 10 elements?
How many subsets have 30 elements? How many have 0 elements?

n = 37
k = 10

37! / (10! (37-10)!) = 37! / ( 10! 27! ) = 348 330 136
37! / (30! (37-30)!) = 37! / (30! 7!) = 10295472
37! / (0! (37-0)!) = 37! / 37! = 1

2. Suppose A is a set for which |A| = 100. How many subsets of A have 5 elements?
How many subsets have 10 elements? How many have 99 elements?

100! / (5! * 95!) = 75287520
100! / (10! * 90!) = 17310309456440

3. A set X has exactly 56 subsets with 3 elements. What is the cardinality of X ?

|X| = a
a! / (3! (a - 3)!) = 56

6(a-3)! * 56 = a!
336(a-3)! = a!
336 = a!/(a-3)!

a! = a(a-1)!
(a-1)! = (a-1)(a-2)!
(a-2)! = (a-2)(a-3)!

a! = a(a-1)(a-2)(a-3)!
