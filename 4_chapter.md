Part II
Chapter 4

Definition 4.3 Two integers have the same parity if they are both even or they are both odd. Otherwise they have opposite parity

Definition 4.4 Suppose a and b are integers. We say that a divides b, written a | b, if b = ac for some c in Z. In this case we also say that a is a divisor of b, and that b is a multiple of a.

4.3 Direct Proof
(proposition is a statement that, although true, is not as significant as a theorem.)

Suppose we have:
Proposition If P, then Q.

The goal is to show that this statement is true.
1. When P is false, P => Q is always true, so we don't have to worry about this case.
2. When P is true we must show that Q is also true



*Outline of Direct Proof*

Proposition If P, then Q.

Proof. Suppose P.
...
Therefore Q.

Example:

1) Proposition If x is odd, then x^2 is odd.
Proof. Suppose x is odd.

Therefore x^2 is odd.

2) Proposition If x is odd, then x^2 is odd.    
Proof. Suppose x is odd.    
x = 2b + 1 by definition of an odd number.    
...    
Therefore x^2 is odd.    


3) Proposition If x is odd, then x^2 is odd.    
Proof. Suppose x is odd.    
x = 2a + 1 by definition of an odd number.    
...    
x^2 = 2b + 1    
Therefore x^2 is odd.    


4) Proposition If x is odd, then x^2 is odd.    
Proof. Suppose x is odd.    
x = 2a + 1 by definition of an odd number.    
Then x^2 = (2a + 1)^2 = 4a^2 + 4a + 1 = 2a(2a + 1) + 1    
...    
x^2 = 2b + 1    
Therefore x^2 is odd.    

5) Proposition If x is odd, then x^2 is odd.    
Proof. Suppose x is odd.    
x = 2a + 1 by definition of an odd number.    
Then x^2 = (2a + 1)^2 = 4a^2 + 4a + 1 = 2(2a^2 + 2a) + 1    
So x^2 = 2b + 1 where b = (2a^2 + 2a)    
Therefore x^2 is odd.    

Exercises for Chapter 4
Use the method of direct proof to prove the following statements.
1. If x is an even integer, then x^2 is even.
