Contrapositive Proof     

Since P => Q is equivalent to ~Q => ~P the latter expression is called the contrapositive (logically equivalent) form of P => Q.    

Outline for Contrapositive Proof.    
Proposition If P, then Q.    
Proof. Suppose ~Q.    
...    
Then ~P.    


Proposition.    
Suppose x in Z. If 7 x+9 is even, then x is odd.
