Contrapositive Proof     

Since P => Q is equivalent to ~Q => ~P the latter expression is called the contrapositive (logically equivalent) form of P => Q.    

Outline for Contrapositive Proof.    
Proposition If P, then Q.    
Proof. Suppose ~Q.    
...    
Then ~P.    


Proposition.    
Suppose x in Z. If 7x+9 is even, then x is odd.    
Suppose x is even.    
Then x = 2a.    
7(2a) + 9 = 14a + 9 = 14a + 8 + 1 = 2(7a + 4) + 1.    
7x + 9 = 2b + 1, where b = 7a + 4.     
Thus 7x + 9 is odd.     
If x is not odd and 7x + 9 is not even, then if x is odd then 7x + 9 is even.    



Suppose x in Z. If x^2 - 6x + 5 is even, then x is odd.    
Suppose x is even.    
Then x = 2a.    
4a^2 - 12a + 5 = 4a^2 - 12a + 4 + 1 = 2(2a^2 - 6a + 2) + 1.    
Thus x^2 - 6x + 5 is odd.    
If x is not odd, x^2 - 6x + 5 is not even, so if x is odd, then x^2 - 6x + 5 is even.



Suppose x, y in R. If y^3 + yx^2 <= x^3 xy^2, then y <= x
