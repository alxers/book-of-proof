Chapter 6.     

Proof by contradiction.     


The basic idea is to assume that the statement we want to prove is false, and then show that this assumption leads to nonsense.      

Proposition.     
If a, b in Z, then a^2 - 4b != 2.      


Example:     
If a, b in Z, then a^2 - 4b != 2.     
Suppose this statement is false.     
It means that there exist a, b for which a, b in Z but a^2 - 4b = 2.     
a^2 - 4b = 2.     
a^2 = 2 + 4b = 2(1 + 2b) which is even.     
If a^2 even, then a is even.     
So a = 2x.     
4x^2 - 4b = 2.     
4(x^2 - b) = 2.      
2(x^2 - b) = 1.     
1 is even, which is false.     
So the initial statement is true.

Therefore C ^ ∼C.     


*Definition 6.1* A real number x is rational if x = a/b for some a, b in Z.     
Also, x is irrational if it is not rational, that is if x != a/b for every a, b in Z.     


Example:     
The number sqrt(2) is irrational.     
Suppose it's not true, that sqrt(2) is irrational, then it must be rational.     
sqrt(2) = a/b, a, b in Z.     
a and b are not both even, because in this case the a/b could be simplified.     
2 = a^2/b^2.      
a^2 = 2b^2, then a^2 is even, so a is even.     
Then b can't be even, because a and b are not both even.     
a = 2x.     
2 = 4x^2/b^2.     
2b^2 = 4x^2.      
b^2 = 2x^2 which is even, but b can't be even, we have a contradiction.     
Then it must be that the initial statement is true.
