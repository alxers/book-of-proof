Proving Non-Conditional Statements.     


7.1 If-and-Only-If Proof.      

This statement asserts that both of the     
following conditional statements are true:     
If P, then Q.     
If Q, then P.

Proposition     
The integer n is odd if and only if n^2 is odd.    

(Direct). Suppose n is odd, then n = 2a + 1 by definition of an odd number.     
Then n^2 = (2a + 1)^2 = 4a^2 + 4a + 1.     
4a^2 + 4a + 1 = 2(2a^2 + 2a) + 1 which is odd.     

Conversely we need to prove that n^2 being odd implies that n is odd.      
(Contrapositive). Suppose n is not odd, then n is even, n = 2a.     
n^2 = 4a^2 = 2(2a^2) which is even.     
So n^2 is even. This is contrapositive proof that if n^2 is odd then n is odd.      


Proposition Suppose a and b are integers. Then a ≡ b (mod 6) if and only if a ≡ b (mod 2) and a ≡ b (mod 3).        
Proof. First we prove that a ≡ b (mod 6).     
Suppose a ≡ b (mod 6), then 6 | (a - b).     
(a - b) = 6x.     
(a - b) = 2(3x), which means 2 | (a - b), a ≡ b (mod 2).     
(a - b) = 3(2x), which means 3 | (a - b), a ≡ b (mod 3).
