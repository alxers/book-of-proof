Proof Involving Sets      


How to show a in { x : P(x) }     
Show that P(a) is true.     


How to show a in { x in S : P(x) }      
1. Verify that a in S.     
2. Show that P(a) is true.     


How to Prove A set_in B      
(Direct approach)      

Proof. Suppose a in A.     
...     
Therefore a in B.      
Thus a in A implies a in B,     
so it follows that A set_in B.     



How to Prove A set_in B      
(Contrapositive)     

Proof. Suppose a not in B.     
...     
Therefore a in A.     
Thus a not in B implies a not in A,     
so it follows that A set_in B.     



How to Prove A = B.     

Proof.     
[Prove that A set_in B.]     
[Prove that B set_in A.]     
Therefore, since A set_in B and B set_in A,      
it follows that A = B.      


Ex.      

14. (A union B) - C = (A - C) union (B - C).     
{ x: (x in A or x in B) and (x not_in C) } =     
= { x: (x in A and x not_in C) or (x in B and x not_in C) }
