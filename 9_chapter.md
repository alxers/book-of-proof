Exercises for Chapter 9      


1. If x, y in R, then |x + y| = |x| + |y|.     
Conterexample: x = 2, y = -5;      
|2-5| = 3; |2| + |-5| = 7;      



2. For every natural number n, the integer 2n^2 - 4n + 31 is prime.      
2n^2 - 4n + 31 = n(2n - 4) + 31.      
For n = 31; 31(2n - 4) + 31 = 31((2n - 4) + 1) which is not prime.      



3. If n in Z and n^5 - n is even, then n is even.     
Conterexample. 3^5 - 3 = 240, 3 is not even.     


4. For every natural number n, the integer n^2 + 17n + 17 is prime.     
Conterexample. n = 17, then 17 | n^2, 17 | 17n, 17 | 17.
