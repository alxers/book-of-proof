Exercises for Chapter 9      


1. If x, y in R, then |x + y| = |x| + |y|.     
Conterexample: x = 2, y = -5;      
|2-5| = 3; |2| + |-5| = 7;      



2. For every natural number n, the integer 2n^2 - 4n + 31 is prime.      
2n^2 - 4n + 31 = n(2n - 4) + 31.      
For n = 31; 31(2n - 4) + 31 = 31((2n - 4) + 1) which is not prime.
