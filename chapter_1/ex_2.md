The Cartesian Product

Given two sets A and B, it's possible to "mulitply" them. A x B will produce a new set. This operation is called the Cartesian product.

Definition. An ordered pair is a list (x, y) of two things.
F.e. (2, 4) and (4, 2) are different ordered pairs.
Ordered pairs don't have to be numbers.

Definition. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is another set, denoted as A x B and defined as A x B = {(a, b) : a in A, b in B}.

Cartesian powers of sets.
A^n is a cartesian product of A with itself n times:
A^n = A x A x ... x A = { (x1, x2,..., x_n) : x1, x2,..., x_n in A }.
