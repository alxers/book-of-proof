The Cartesian Product

Given two sets A and B, it's possible to "mulitply" them. A x B will produce a new set. This operation is called the Cartesian product.

Definition. An ordered pair is a list (x, y) of two things.
F.e. (2, 4) and (4, 2) are different ordered pairs.
Ordered pairs don't have to be numbers.

Definition. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is another set, denoted as A x B and defined as A x B = {(a, b) : a in A, b in B}.

Cartesian powers of sets.
A^n is a cartesian product of A with itself n times:
A^n = A x A x ... x A = { (x1, x2,..., x_n) : x1, x2,..., x_n in A }.

1. A = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, B = { a, c }

(a) A x B = { (1, a), (1, c), (2, a), (2, c), (3, a), (3, c), (4, a), (4, c) }    
(b) B x A = { (a, 1), (a, 2), (a, 3), (a, 4), (c, 1), (c, 2), (c, 3), (c, 4) }    
(c) A x A = { (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4) }    
(e) {} x B = {}    
(h) B^3 = B x B x B = ?    

2. A = { pi, e, 0 }, B = { 0, 1 }    
(a) A x B = { (pi, 0), (pi, 1), (e, 0), (e, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1) }
